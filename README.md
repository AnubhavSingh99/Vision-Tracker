## Introduction
Vision Tracker is designed to identify human faces and interpret their emotions using advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques. This application can process images and videos, providing real-time analysis and feedback.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Uses Haar Cascades to identify faces in images and live webcam feeds.
- **Facial Landmark Detection**: Offers detailed facial analysis through landmark detection.
- **Emotion Recognition**: Utilizes the FER library to detect emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more.
- **Image and Video Processing**: Supports uploading images, capturing real-time video, and saving detected faces and emotions.

## Tech Stack
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and face detection.
- **FER Library**: For emotion recognition.
- **Tkinter**: For creating a user-friendly GUI.
- **Python**: The core programming language for this project.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/AnubhavSingh99/Vision-Tracker.git
    cd Vision-Tracker
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage
Once the application is running, you can:
- **Upload Images**: Choose an image file to detect faces and emotions.
- **Capture Real-Time Video**: Use your webcam to detect faces and emotions in real-time.
- **Save Results**: Save the processed images and videos with detected faces and emotions.
